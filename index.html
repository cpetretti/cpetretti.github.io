							<h2><b>About Me</b></h2>
								<p>I received my Bachelor of Science (B.S.) from Villanova University, where I majored in Astrophysics and 
									minored in Physics, Mathematics, and Classical Studies. During my time at Villanova, I researched the orbital patterns of 
									black-hole X-ray binaries. I received internships at MIT Haystack Observatory,
									where I was involved in multiple projects studying the configurations of VLBI arrays, namely the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) 
									and the Next Generation Very Large Array (ngVLA). I began my Ph.D. in 
									2022 at Harvard University, where my research focus has shifted to inflation and early universe cosmology.</p>

							<h2><b>My Research</b></h2>
								<p>Inflation is a scenario in which the universe underwent a rapid exponential expansion ~10<sup>-34</sup> seconds 
									after the Big Bang. Our most direct observations of inflation come from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) 
									temperature and polarization anisotropies. However, these measurements do not offer enough precision to 
									probe inflation directly. Furthermore, there are many different proposed models of inflation that are 
									consistent with observations, and without more precise measurements, we cannot 
									distinguish between these models. However, there are a number of CMB experiments planned for the next decade, 
									such as SPT, CMB Stage-4, Simons Observatory, and LiteBIRD, that will aim to measure the CMB with uprecedented 
									precision.</p>
									<p>
									My work is at the itnersection of theory and observations. My research involves fundamental physics of inflationary field
									 theories to 
									determine their expected observational signals. In addition, I analyze current CMB data and simulating measurements from upcoming 
									missions to see if we will be able to detect or distinguish between different inflationary models, and other 
									 beyond-&Lambda;CDM cosmological models, in the coming decades. (Image credit: Big Think / Ben Gibson)</p>
